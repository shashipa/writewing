It allows these submarines to remain undetected on their ocean patrols. It makes these ICMBs extremely deadly. At the same time positions of stationary silo-based ballistic missiles are known and are targeted by hostile nuclear missiles. So ballistic submarines with Trident II missiles have a high probability of surviving the first strike, once the country has been attacked. It is planned that upgraded versions of the Trident II missiles will remain in service until 2042.', '                            The R-36M2 missile has a range of 11 000 km and carries up to 10 MIRVs with a blast yield of 0.75-1 MT and up to 40 penetration aids. So its nuclear warheads are hard to intercept by air defense systems. CEP is 220 m. So even though it is not the most accurate missile it coupes in full with its payload. Some sources report that a single SS-18 Satan missile with MIRVs can completely destroy 3 US states, such as Maryland, Vermont, and Rhode Island.   The Satan is a silo-based missile. Silos are located in dispersed locations across Russia. The silo launcher and command point are hardened against a nuclear explosion.', ' \r\n                           However positions of these missiles are known. That why this missile is ranked second on this list. Though in terms of range and payload it is clearly superior to the US Trident II.\r\n   The number of operational Satan missiles is steadily decreasing due to their age. Missiles that age past their designed operational lifetime are being withdrawn. Currently there are a total of 58 R-36M2 missiles deployed by the Russian Strategic Missile Forces. In around 2020 the R-36 series missiles will be replaced by the new RS-28 Sarmat (SS-X-30 Satan 2) ICBM, that is currently being developed in Russia.\r\n', '                             It is mounted on top of the missile, \r\nbut unlike a regular re-entry vehicle it can make sharp maneuvers. Some sources report that the Avangard can reach speeds of 33 300 km/h (Mach 27). Conventional interceptor missiles have difficulty intercepting targets traveling at 6 173 km/h (Mach 5). Furthermore gliding extends its range and allows to approach a target on an unpredictable ballistic trajectory. It was planned that in 2019 a total of 31 Yars missiles will be equipped with Avangard gliding re-entry vehicles and will be deployed operationally.   The Yars was designed to overcome missile defense systems. This missile maneuvers during the flight and carries both active and passive decoys. It is estimated that it has at least a 60-65% chance to penetrate defenses. The road-mobile Yars uses the same highly mobile 16x16 wheeled chassis as the previous Topol-M. Externally both missiles look similar, but the Yars are heavier and more capable. \r\n \r\n', '                            The mobile launcher has 500 km of autonomy on roads. Once on high alert the Yars TELs can leave their bases and operates in remote forest areas to increase their survivability. Its autonomy allows the mobile launcher with missile to operate undetected in an area equivalent to a small European country. So such road-mobile ICBMs are harder to detect and hit. These have a high probability of surviving the first strike, once the country has been attacked.  A silo-based version of the Yars is compatible with a silo of older Russian ICBMs, that was phased out of service. It uses the complete infrastructure of the previous missiles. It only takes to load the new missile into the silo. A typical silo-based unit has a total of 10 Yars missiles and a command post.\r\n', '                            There are 450 of these missiles in the US service. Another 50 to 75 missiles are in reserve. That\'s the biggest number of ballistic missiles in the world. These are managed by the United States Air Force Global Strike Command. There are silos to fire the Minuteman III missile all around the United States, like in Montana, North Dakota,\r\n Wyoming and other US Air Force bases. However all of these missiles are stationary and their positions are known.', '                             The Minuteman III missile has a maximum range of 13 000 km. The original inertial navigation system provided it with an accuracy of about 200 m CEP, but an updated inertial guidance system gives it 120 m CEP. The Minuteman III carries a payload of three independently targetable reentry vehicles. Each one of these MIRVs has armed with a nuclear warhead with a destructive power between 300 to 500 kT. It also carries penetration aids to counter enemy missile defense systems. So the Minuteman III is agile and has the longest range, but might not be the best intercontinental missile in the world. However the United States operates hundreds of these missiles, so quantity has its own quality.\r\n', '                           The unusual feature of this missile is that warheads can be of a mixed set with various yields. This missile is equipped with improved systems to overcome anti-ballistic missile shields. It carries decoys. Furthermore it can be configured to can carry less nuclear warheads, but more decoys. As of 2016 a total of 6 Delta IV class submarines, equipped with ballistic missiles, are in service with the Russian Navy. \r\n ', '                          Submarine basing of the ICBMs allows us to survive the first strike. However the Russian Delta IV submarines are not as stealthy as the US or British ballistic missiles. Still, though these have a higher chance of surviving than silo-based systems. Furthermore these missiles have sufficient range to be fired straight from the pier, even without the need for the submarines to leave their well-protected bases.\r\n   It is planned that the Delta IV class submarines will be operational until at least 2030.\r\n', '                           Each missile carries 6-10 independently targetable warheads. Each has a blast yield of 107 kT. Furthermore missile carries penetration aids in order to overcome hostile air defenses. A newer version of this missile, which appeared in 2015, the M51.2, carries much more powerful 150 kT warheads. These French ICBMs have Astro-inertial guidance. Galileo satellite navigation system is planned, but not yet fitted. ', '                          So these missiles may not be as accurate as contemporary missiles with satellite navigation systems. The CEP of this missile is around 150-200 meters.   France operates a total of 4 Le Triomphant class submarines. Each of them carries 16 ballistic missiles. So a total of 64 missiles are ready to use. These submarine-based missiles have a high probability of surviving the first strike. Once on high alerts these submarines can leave their bases and operate undetected in the Atlantic ocean. The upgraded version of the M51, the M51.3 is being developed. But it will enter service only in around 2025.\r\n\r\n ', '                            \r\n                            This missile has an internal navigation system with an indigenous Chinese BeiDou satellite navigation system update. It could be accurate to 150 meters, or possibly, even more, accurate is even more accurate.  The DF-41 is based on Taian HTF5980 special wheeled chassis with a 16x16 configuration. This vehicle has some degree of cross-country mobility and can travel over various terrain. Interestingly China has gained a number of heavy high mobility vehicle chassis technology from Belarusian MZKT company. A joint Chinese and Belarusian venture was established for production of special wheeled chassis in China.\r\n\r\n ', '                             Eventually a number of Chinese multi-axle vehicles, designed to carry ballistic missiles. emerged, that was based on the Belarusian MZKT designs and technology. Furthermore China has quickly become the second country after Belarus, capable of designing and producing launch vehicles for ultra-heavy intercontinental missiles. Even Russia, that historically uses road-mobile ICBMs lacks this technology and expertise and obtains launcher vehicles from Belarus.  A number of previous Chinese road-mobile ICBMs are stored in tunnels. Hence the missiles are well protected. Once on high alert the road-mobile launchers leave the tunnels and fire their missiles from nearby launch positions. Alternatively the launcher vehicles can leave their bases and operate undetected in remote areas. Their autonomy allows the vehicles to operate in an area equivalent to a \r\nsmall European country. So mobile China\'s missiles are typically harder to intercept and destroy than stationary silo-based missiles.\r\n These have a high probability of surviving the first strike once the country has been attacked.\r\n\r\n ', '                           The DF-31AG is a modified and upgraded version of the DF-31A. The previous DF-31A missile is silo-based, while its road-mobile version is based on a semi-trailer. On the other hand the new DF-31AG is based on an 8-axle launcher vehicle and is more mobile. This feature widens its deployment options and thus increases survivability. In concept the DF-31AG is similar to Russian road-mobile ICBMs such as Topol and Yars.  The DF-31AG is a solid-fuel missile. It has three stages. This missile has a range of 11 200 km and can reach all areas of United States,\r\n Europe and Russia. While the older DF-31A carries a single warhead, the new DF-31AG reportedly carries multiple independently-targetable warheads (MIRVs).\r\n There is a version of the DF-31, that carries 3 MIRVs with 20, 90, or 150 kT blast yield capacity each. Furthermore the DF-31AG has a longer range and improved survivability.   The missile has an internal navigation system with an indigenous Chinese BeiDou satellite navigation system. Some sources suggest that it has an accuracy of 150 meters, or is even more accurate.', '                            This missile carries decoys in order to overcome missile defense systems.\r\n   Transporter Erector Launcher (TEL) vehicle is based on 8-axle Taian special wheeled chassis. The TEL vehicle has some degree of cross-country mobility, though it is mainly intended to operate on hard surface roads. The vehicle has autonomy on roads of around 500 km.  Once on high alert the road-mobile DF-31AG missiles can leave their bases and operate in remote areas. Its autonomy allows the vehicle to operate undetected in an area equivalent to a small European country. Such mobile missiles are typically harder to intercept than stationary silo-based missiles. As a result these have a high probability of surviving the first strike once the country has been attacked.\r\n', '                            This missile Astro-inertial navigation system with indigenous Chinese BeiDou satellite navigation system update. It is estimated that this missile has a CEP of less than 100 m. Each Jin-class submarine carries 12 of these missiles. As of 2019 China operates at least 4 of these ballistic missile submarines. Two more boats of this class are being constructed. These submarine-based missiles have a high probability of surviving the first strike. Once on high alert these submarines can leave their bases and operate in China\'s coastal water, protected by China\'s fleet. However the Jin-class submarines are not as advanced as the Western ballistic missile submarines, and are inferior to the Russian submarines. \r\n\r\n \r\n     ', '                            China was always dragging behind in terms of submarine technology. These submarines are not as stealthy as the current Western and Russian submarines. These areas are noisy as the Russian Delta III class submarines, that were adopted back in the mid-1970s. Some sources report that the next-generation Type 096 class boats are being built and should begin sea trials in the early 2020s. Also a new JL-3 submarine-launched ballistic missile is being developed for these boats.', '                            It has a declared range of 9 500 km. This missile can carry 6 MIRVs with a yield of 150 kT each. It can also carry 10 MIRVs, though to a range of only 4 000 km. The Bulava has Astro-inertial guidance with the Russian GLONASS satellite navigation system update. It has a CEP of 350 m. This missile was designed to overcome hostile air defenses. Once the country has been attacked these submarine-based missiles have high chances of surviving the first strike. Each Borei class submarine can carry 16 missiles. As of 2017 there are 3 of these submarines in service with the Russian Navy. ', '                          The Bulava missile has the potential to be road-mobile or rail-based. On paper the Bulava is more capable than some of the missiles on this Top 10 list. However it still has teething problems that need to be fixed. It is planned that Borei class submarines with these missiles will form a core of the Russian nuclear triad until 2040.');
