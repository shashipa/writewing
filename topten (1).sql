The four innermost planets are probably tidally locked, but Kepler-186f is in a higher orbit, where the star\'s tidal effects are much weaker, so the time could have been insufficient for its spin to slow down significantly. ', ' Because of the very slow evolution of red dwarfs, the age of the Kepler-186 system was poorly constrained, although it is likely to be greater than a few billion years. Recent results have placed the age at around 4 billion years. The chance that it is tidally locked is approximately 50%.

The host star, with about an eighth of the mass of the Sun, has a habitable zone  In October 2016, ', 'researchers at France\'s CNRS research institute stated that there is a considerable chance of the planet harboring surface oceans and having a \nthin atmosphere. However, unless the planet transits in front of its star from the perspective of Earth, it is difficult to test these hypotheses. Even though Proxima Centauri b is in the habitable zone, the planet\'s habitability has been questioned because of several potentially hazardous physical conditions. The exoplanet is close enough to its host star that it might be tidally locked. In this case, it is expected that any habitable areas would be confined to the border region between the two extreme sides, generally referred to as the terminator line, since it is only here that temperatures might be suitable for liquid water to exist.\n\n', 'The planet is about 1,400 light-years away from the Solar System.

If Kepler-452b is a rocky planet, it may be subject to a runaway greenhouse effect similar to that seen on Venus. However, due to the planet being 60% bigger than Earth, it is likely to have an estimated mass of 5 M, which could allow it to hold on to any oceans it may have for a longer period, preventing Kepler-452b from succumbing to runaway greenhouse effect for another 500 million years. This could allow any potential life on the surface to inhabit the planet for another 500–900 million years before the habitable zone is pushed out of Kepler-452b\'s orbit.\n', 'The planet was announced as orbiting within the habitable zone of Kepler-438, a region where liquid water could exist on the surface of the planet.

Researchers at the University of Warwick say that Kepler-438b is not habitable due to the large amount of radiation it receives.', ' The question of what makes a planet habitable is much more complex than having a planet located at the right distance from its host star so that water can be liquid on its surface. various geophysical and geodynamical aspects, the radiation, and the host stars plasma environment can influence the evolution of planets and life if it originated.

In 2014, we expanded to 17 more villages and now work with over 2,600 families to increase access to quality health care services and education, improve food security and nutrition, foster gender equality, and enhance livelihood systems and environmental protection — some of the main causes of global poverty. \n', 'Today, however, the country (which gained independence from France in 1960) has a GNI per capita of $1,953 and a life expectancy of 58.5. ', 'Ongoing war and conflict mean that the mean years of schooling in the country is just 2.3 (compared to an expected 7.7 years of schooling). The World Bank’s most recent data from 2009 reveal that over 41% of the population lives below the poverty line. ', 'According to the World Bank’s most recent estimate in 2014, over 46% of Mozambicans live below the poverty line. While it’s\n anticipated that citizens will complete 9.7 years of schooling, the mean years of schooling completed is just 3.5. \n', 'Concern previously worked in Mozambique between 1984 and 2017 and returned to the country in 2019 following the landfall of two major cyclones in the country (including Cyclone Idai). This emergency response has now moved into an early-recovery phase, as we equip subsistence farmers with seeds and other agricultural inputs to help them replace crops destroyed by flooding.\n', 'Growing gold production in September at the all-important Kumtor mine powered the rebound in economic activity recorded in the January–September period, when GDP increased slightly in annual terms, from the small contraction recorded in January–August. That said, cumulative mining output in January–September was still much lower than in the same period last year, which translated into falling exports. On the other hand, during the same time span, sustained wage increases and rising remittances led to a solid expansion in retail sales while both capital investment and construction increased strongly.\n', 'GDP growth is set to accelerate next year, as production at the Kumtor gold mine increases, driving output growth in the industrial sector. \nSolid consumer spending, fueled by healthy wage growth and higher remittances from Russia, will also underpin the expansion. A possible cooling in economic activity in Russia due to U.S. sanctions, however, cloud the outlook. FocusEconomics projects GDP growth of 4.3% in 2019 and 4.5% in 2020.\n', ' The country has a life expectancy of 52.2 years, with a GNI per capita of $1,240 and mean years of schooling at 3.5 (compared to the expected 9.8 years). Concern first entered Sierra Leone during the country’s civil war, and we’ve been there for 23 years. ', 'While the Ebola outbreak has passed and the economy has rebounded in part due to the resumption of iron ore mining, the outlook is still challenging. One area of focus for us is the country’s \nenvironmental challenges, which are directly linked to a number of potential emergencies (such as the 2017 mudslide). \n');
